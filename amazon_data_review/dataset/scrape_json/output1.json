        "I have a 15 year old VERY sweet dog who has been having issues lately. No matter how expensive the dog food I buy (organic, grain free, human grade, RX grade)  it doesn\u2019t matter, she was still getting sick. I bought this and placed it on top of her food and she ADORES it! It\u2019s easy for sick dogs to digest because it\u2019s baby food. It\u2019s more liquid than paste (like thick pea soup) and she laps it up. I couldn\u2019t find any organic baby food in the store that had chicken in it for her in a squeeze pouch. This gives her low sodium, protein and veggies. There are 5 ingredients. Look at the back of Hills RX Science Diet and you will be horrified at what is in that food! This is much better for a dog with a sensitive tummy. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s great for babies but she is my baby. When dogs are sick they recommend baby food and this is the best.$$$",
        "This product should not be marketed for under one year olds! It contains added Himalayan salt. Added salt is harmful for babies as their kidneys can\u2019t cope with it.$$$",
        "You owe it your children or even to yourself to buy the most well thought out, healthy ingredient conscious baby food on the market.  Candidly, I have severe autoimmune diseases with coninfections so absorption of solid food is challenging Recently my doctor suggested baby food as I am barely digesting. After weeks of researching I was shocked to see all the preservatives and SUGARS used in basically all baby food lines EXCEPT Serenity.  I have learned a lot about which foods feed on or create yeast, viruses, bacteria etc in the gut which basically runs our body.  When the stomach does not work right the rest of the body does not as a consequence. Serenity has done their research as they are utilizing organic based, non gmo, hormone free, antibiotic free ingredients.  They put together packets in which the ingredients combine well to present a well balanced healthy meal even adults can eat and enjoy. Most people do not realize that what we ingest is paramount to how our bodies develop, grow and heal.  Healthy eating should begin at the onset when a child is born so they start  eating foods which can literally affect their health as they grow and develop. Today, for instance I had grass fed meat, organic sweet potatoes and organic kale which were easily digested without any deleterious side effects. The wild caught salmon is delicious and tastes better than fish purchased in the grocery store and the squashes are yummy too.  There are still many selections from which to chose so I'm never bored and look forward to discovering different meals to enjoy. Much gratitude for finding this company and to the owner's who thoughtfully created this baby food line. Sincerely, Mindy in Florida$$$",
        "We've tried just about every pouch and jar baby food containing meat, and this is literally the only one my little girl will touch.  You can tell it's made with high quality ingredients, and the nutritional content is spot on with the right mix of protein, fats and carbohydrates.  We started buying it through their site with a promo code, and shipping has been extremely fast.  I recommend it to everyone!$$$",
        "All my life I believed that bacon had the culinary might to make the worst cooking and the foulest of ingredient choices into a passable dish.  This irredeemable paste has taught me the naivety of that perspective.  I had never before experienced the ability of kale to make anything taste like the back end of a donkey.  The inescapable truth is that this goop is awful.  I'm not saying that the makers should be the first up against the wall when the revolution comes, but I could understand if they came second or third.  Certainly any rational group of people should have a reaction to this being sold as a baby food that involves torches and pitchforks.  If you think this perspective is excessive, I invite you to try this culinary atrocity for yourself.$$$",
        "We (and baby boy) love this brand and subscribe to all flavors. The 6-pack here with the discount is a little better than purchasing it locally at our Whole Foods. We decided to use Serenity Kids when learning about feeding and trying to avoid too many super sugary heavily processed foods. Our son's first bite was actually one of the Vege flavors at 4.5 months because my wife wasn't able to breast feed for long and he was on formula early on. I felt much happier knowing that he's getting healthy fats and proteins. I think Beef is his favorite and he's initially cautious with the Salmon but usually scarfs everything down. At 6 months, he eats 2 packets a day (lunch and dinner) and about 30+ oz of formula. Soon we might start adding another packet. As soon as he started eating these, he was able to sleep an entire night 11-12 hours. Previously he was waking up every 2-3 hours.$$$",
        "I was so happy to find a good quality, high protein baby food. We try to follow the Weston A Price plan for nourishing a baby, as it tries to coordinate digestibility and developmental appropriateness. With my second baby, I am relying more on store bought pouches, and not making from scratch. This is as close to that as possible as what I would do from scratch and with the Weston A Price plan. My baby is has always enjoyed the flavors. I started with the beef, and moved to the turkey and chicken. Sometimes, I mix in another more fruity pouch. We rarely finish a whole pouch in one setting, so the cost goes a long way. I'll add a few grains of pink mineral salt, and a few drops of cod liver oil. Baby loves it!! Thank you guys for offering this product!$$$",
        "We have ordered the salmon, beef, and bacon, and my 2-year-old loves all of them. He doesn't eat them often anymore (though he did eat them a lot when he was younger) but we keep several in the diaper bag in case we are out longer than expected and he's starving. He always wolfs them down, and that just thrills me to death. Sometimes if I leave the diaper bag where he can get to it at home, he will find the pouches and want to eat them! Pantry staple for us. We will continue to buy them for him, and for our second baby whenever that happens. We love Serenity Kids!! Please come out with toddler food!$$$"
