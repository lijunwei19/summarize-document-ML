        "We\u2019ve opened four now and they have all been crumbled...I\u2019m sure if they can ship to a store without being crunched up then surely they can be sent to my home without being in pieces!$$$",
        "Cups are half full leaving tons of room for the chips to bounce around. At least half the chips in each cup were broken. Terrible packaging all to make it LOOK like you get more.  You do you get more. More broken chips.$$$",
        "I don't know what happens to these from the time they leave production until they arrive at your home, but honestly, I think they play hockey with them, or maybe volleyball. While the idea is great, and I love Pringles, every single cup had more broken pieces than whole. One cup had only 3 chips that were whole. Don't buy these unless you want to use them for breading on your next chicken dinner.$$$",
        "They would be fine if they didn't always arrive broken.$$$",
        "These arrived all broken....$$$",
        "ALL broken. EVERY chip in EVERY package.$$$",
        "Very disappointed to receive these and see that most of the chips were broken. Opened several containers and all the same where perhaps only about 3 chips were not broken in each. Will not order again and don't recommend.$$$",
        "I remember when Pringles went on market claiming to be less greasy than usual potatoe chips and that they were! Seemed strange buying potatoe chips in a can though but that was their trademark to guarantee unbroken chips. I not only equated non-greasy, great tasting flavorful chips with the brand but didn\u2019t experience the usual many broken chips found in other brands, along with pouring into my hand (but more often straight into mouth\ud83e\udd2d) the last of the chips on the bottom that were so crushed that putting together a whole chip would make for a 1000 piece puzzle! Too bad they couldn\u2019t pack snack-sized into cans but I guess it would be costly and I got mine for under $7 and wouldn\u2019t pay extra for perfect chips. As another reviewer mentioned the container is 1/2 chips and 1/2 extra space which makes for broken chips! If not for this flaw I would have given 5 stars because I think they\u2019re the best tasting chips out there! Also like to control portions with individual containers!$$$"
